# Operating-System-project
  An operating system that was written over the course of one semester, CSEN 602-Operating Systems, Spring 2016.  In this project, we built a tiny yet functional operating system similar to CP/M 1 from scratch. The operating system that we implemented is
intended to fit on a 3 1/2 inch floppy disk, and to be bootable on any normal x86 PC. The operating system is to be programmed primarily in C with a small amount of assembly functions.
  In this project we wrote routines to read, delete, and write files into memory as well as executing programs. Then wrote a shell program that executes other programs, print out ASCII text files along with other several commands
